The data was acquired from two different sites using two different scanning protocols. Images with swapped phase encoding for field map correction with topup were only collected from one of the sites. The JSON data for each nifi file explains the parameters used at that site.

General Comments
----------------

Slice acquisition order was interleaved Bottom/UP for both sites.
Site 1: sub-01 through sub-06
Site 2: sub-07 through sub-19

We collected data from two different sites. The first set were collected on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Allegra scanner located at Princeton University. The second set were collected on a 3.0 Tesla GE Discovery scanner located at the Banner Alzheimer Institute (BAI) in Phoenix, Arizona. High-resolution T1-weighted images were first acquired (Princeton: 1×1×1 mm resolution, BAI: .9×.9×.9 mm resolution, MP-RAGE sequence). Whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) weighted echo-planar images were acquired using an interleaved acquisition (TR = 2000 ms; TE=30 ms; flip angle=90° (Princeton) 77.2° (BAI), slices: 30 total, 4mm thickness (Princeton), 36 total, 3.4 mm thickness (BAI); FOV: 192 mm (Princeton), 222 mm (BAI) matrix = 64×64 (Princeton), 74x74 (BAI), prescription: 30° (Princeton) or 0° (BAI) off the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line). The data sets were acquired several years apart and differences arose from an evolving understanding of the best parameters for acquiring fMRI data.


Defacing
--------
Pydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure deindentification of subjects. The code
can be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface

Quality Control
---------------
Mriqc was run on the dataset. Results are located in derivatives/mriqc. Learn more about it here: https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Where to discuss the dataset
----------------------------
1) www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds000223/ See the comments section at the bottom of the dataset
page.
2) www.neurostars.org Please tag any discussion topics with the tags openfmri and ds000223
accession number.
3) Send an email to submissions@openfmri.org. Please include the ds000223 accession number in
your email.

Known Issues
------------
- Only the subjects from one of the sites have field map data hence for few subjects fieldmap data is missing
- Several parameters are not the same across the sites
